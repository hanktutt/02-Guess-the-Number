# 02-Guess-the-number

I created a game that consists of trying to guess a random number between 1-20 given 10 guesses.
To make my game more unique I also created a deathtrap that instantly ends the game.
The theme of my game is Star Wars, and the mission is to join the Rebel Alliance to help them shut down the Empires shields.
It is your job to use the hints provided after your guess (too high/ too low), in the limited amount of guesses, and also avoiding the deathtrap in order to be victorious in this mission.
